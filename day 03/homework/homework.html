    <p>monkey</p>
    <p>n the nineteen-twenties, F. W. Champion, a British photographer, adventurer, and officer in the Imperial Forestry Service, developed a novel way to photograph India’s wildlife population. With the help of a tame elephant named Balmati, Champion roved the forests of India. When he found a well-travelled tiger route, he would set up a camera rigged up with trip wires, and leave it there overnight. (As Champion wrote in his book “With a Camera in Tiger-Land,” “pictures of tigers by daylight are not truly representative of such nocturnal beasts.”) When an unsuspecting beast would duff the line, the camera’s shutter and a flash bulb would go off, creating what might today be called an animal selfie.</p>

    <p>dog</p>
    <p>The Japanese Akita and American Akita began to diverge in type post-World War II due to America and Europe preserving the Akitas that fell out of favour in Japan, particularly the Dewa-types and dogs with the signature black mask or pinto marking. American Akitas are typically considered mixed by Japanese breeders (and not true Akitas by the Japanese standard).[citation needed] However, their phenotype predates the Japanese Akita by a few decades, and they are closer to pre-war Akitas like Hachiko.[32][page needed]</p>

    <p>penguin</p>
    <p>Penguins are a group of flightless, semi-aquatic, sea birds which live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. Only one species, the Galápagos penguin, lives at, and slightly north of, the equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.[4]Penguins are a group of flightless, semi-aquatic, sea birds which live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere.
